# Jaxson - a REST API
## Publishes our [Case Management System](https://github.com/peferb/springcasemanagement/blob/master/README.md) as REST

####Made to demonstrate the following techniques:
  + REST
  + Security by Token based authentication ([dev branch](https://github.com/peferb/jaxson/tree/dev))
  + Security by JWT ([jwt branch](https://github.com/peferb/jaxson/tree/peferb_jwt))
  + Hashing and Salting
  + Spring Boot

*Also(just like Case Management) created together in a awesome team with [Johan](https://github.com/Daoey) and [Martin](https://github.com/Martinsodis96)!* :tada:
